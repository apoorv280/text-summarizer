# TEXT-SUMMARIZER

Summarization of articles, letters using gpt-3.

The goal of this project is to use the OpenAI ecosystem, and give an example of how to actually build something from idea to deployment. We will do this by building a Streamlit app that uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 model to summarize text, and then deploy the app to Streamlit Cloud.
